#bcrypt — We will uthenticate users in our application. 
We need to store the password of users in the database. 
So, it is never recommended to store plain text passwords because 
they can be compromised easily.
So; we use bcrypt library to hash the passwords before we save them. 
We will discuss in more detail into when we use it.

#concurrently — This package helps run two processes at the same. We will run both our server and client at the same time without using two separate terminals.

#config — Store important data like secret keys, database ID, in a separate JSON file and access it easily within any file.

#express — Use on top of Node to build REST APIs.

#jsonwebtoken — Create JWTs for authentication.

#mongoose — Establish a connection between MongoDB and our Express app.

#validator — Validate items such as emails.

#nodemon — Keep server running andupdates server when any changes are detected.

We added scripts to make it easier to run the server and client:

#start — Uses node to run the server.js file.

#server — Uses nodemon to run the server.js file to update changes and restart the server automatically.

#client — Runs the client. Use a prefix to indicate first moving into client folder and then run the command.

#dev — Uses concurrently to run both the server and client at the same time.
